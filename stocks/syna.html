                                    We are updating coverage following Synaptics' Q2 FY2026 results, released <strong>February 5, 2026</strong>.
                                    The stock is currently trading at <strong>$85.98</strong>.
                                </p>
                                <h4>Key Highlights</h4>
                                <p><strong>Solid Financial Beat:</strong> Synaptics delivered its fifth consecutive quarter of double-digit growth.
                                    Revenue came in at <strong>$302.5 million (+13% YoY)</strong>, beating estimates.
                                    Non-GAAP EPS was <strong>$1.21</strong>, topping the consensus estimate of $1.15.</p>
                                <p><strong>Core IoT Still Driving Growth:</strong> Core IoT product sales grew <strong>53% year-over-year</strong>.
                                    While this is a deceleration from the 74% growth in Q1, it remains the primary engine of the company's expansion,
                                    masking softer performance in mobile and auto.</p>
                                <p><strong>Valuation Re-Rating:</strong> The stock has rallied ~24% since our last update, reflecting the market's
                                    acceptance of the AI transformation story. With the price at $85.98, the gap to our fair value target of $95.64
                                    has narrowed significantly. We believe the easy money has been made.</p>

                                    The stock traded at <strong>$69.32</strong> at the time of this update.</p>
                                <h4>Key Highlights</h4>
                                <p><strong>Thesis Validation (Core IoT):</strong> Core IoT revenue grew <strong>74% year-over-year</strong>,
                                    significantly outpacing the ~53% growth rate cited in our initial report.
                                    This segment now accounts for 35% of total revenue.</p>
                                <p><strong>Astra Platform Success:</strong> Management confirmed the new Astra AI-native processors are securing
                                    design wins "way ahead" of schedule. Revenue contribution is expected to begin in the second half of calendar 2026.</p>
                                <p><strong>Profitability &amp; Margins:</strong> Non-GAAP EPS grew <strong>35% year-over-year to $1.09</strong>,
                                    driven by solid gross margins of 53.2%.</p>
                                <p><strong>Short-Term Headwinds:</strong> Mobile Touch revenue was lower than expected due to supply chain constraints
                                    and Automotive demand remains subdued. We view the mobile constraints as transitory push-outs, not lost demand.</p>

                        <h3>Business Summary</h3>
                        <p>Synaptics Incorporated develops, markets, and sells specialized semiconductor products that enable intelligent
                            interactions for devices worldwide. The company's diverse product portfolio is built on a foundation of processing,
                            wireless connectivity, sensing, and biometrics. These solutions are deployed across three primary markets: the
                            high-growth <strong>Core IoT</strong> segment, <strong>Enterprise and Automotive</strong>, and the <strong>Mobile</strong> market.</p>
                        <p>Synaptics acts as a strategic partner and supplier to many global Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs). The company's
                            overarching strategy is a focused transition to become a <strong>pure-play Core IoT and Edge AI leader</strong>,
                            divesting legacy mobile exposure while aggressively building out its AI-native processing and wireless connectivity platforms.</p>

                        <h3>Industry Context</h3>
                        <p>Synaptics operates in the highly competitive semiconductor industry, sitting at the intersection of IoT, Edge AI, and
                            wireless connectivity — among the fastest-growing verticals in tech. The company faces formidable rivals with greater
                            scale and financial resources: <strong>Qualcomm</strong> (wireless/AI SoCs), <strong>NXP Semiconductors</strong>
                            (automotive/IoT), and <strong>STMicroelectronics</strong> (sensing/microcontrollers) all compete in overlapping
                            segments.</p>
                        <p>The secular tailwind is powerful: <strong>edge AI chips are projected to reach $60–70 billion by 2030</strong>,
                            driven by the proliferation of intelligent devices that process data locally rather than in the cloud — a trend
                            that directly benefits Synaptics' Astra platform. Simultaneously, the adoption of Wi-Fi 7 and next-gen Bluetooth
                            standards creates a large replacement cycle opportunity for the Veros connectivity portfolio.</p>
                        <p>Against this backdrop, Synaptics is a relatively small-cap player (~$2.7B market cap) competing against giants,
                            which increases both the risk and the potential reward of a successful platform transition.</p>

                        <h3>Competitive Advantages &amp; Moat</h3>
                        <p>Synaptics' competitive advantage is built upon three integrated technology pillars. This platform approach reduces
                            R&amp;D burdens for OEMs, simplifies supply chains, and accelerates time-to-market — creating meaningful
                            switching costs once a customer designs in a Synaptics solution.</p>
                        <p><strong>Processing — Astra™:</strong> The Astra™ platform is the cornerstone of the "AI at the Edge" strategy.
                            It is an AI-native System-on-Chip (SoC) family engineered for real-time edge intelligence, handling advanced
                            vision, audio, and sensor processing directly on the device. A <strong>strategic partnership with Google Research</strong>
                            to co-develop AI accelerators for next-generation Astra processors validates this technology direction and provides
                            a significant R&amp;D co-investment moat.</p>
                        <p><strong>Connectivity — Veros™:</strong> The Veros™ family of highly integrated wireless circuits provides essential
                            connectivity for modern IoT devices. Through a <strong>Wi-Fi 7 licensing agreement with Broadcom</strong> and the
                            acquisition of Packetcraft for Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) capabilities, Synaptics is building a comprehensive,
                            differentiated wireless portfolio that few small-cap peers can match.</p>
                        <p><strong>Sensing (Touch, Display, Biometrics):</strong> This heritage segment represents decades of innovation and
                            customer relationships. The company remains a leader in capacitive touch sensing, display drivers, and biometric
                            solutions across smartphones, PCs, and automotive systems. This established business provides a <strong>stable
                            cash flow foundation</strong> that funds investment in higher-growth Processing and Connectivity segments.</p>

                        <h3>Investment Thesis</h3>
                        <p>Our original conviction in Synaptics at initiation was based on five key points:</p>
                        <p><strong>1. Explosive Core IoT Growth:</strong> The Core IoT segment delivered ~53% revenue growth year-over-year
                            in FY 2025. This segment is increasingly the centerpiece of Synaptics' growth story and is now running at 74%
                            YoY as of Q1 FY2026 — validating the thesis faster than expected.</p>
                        <p><strong>2. Strategic Partnership Expansion:</strong> A collaboration with Google integrates Synaptics' Astra
                            AI-Native platform with Google's ML-Core, accelerating edge AI capabilities. An agreement with Broadcom provides
                            access to best-in-class Wi-Fi 7/8, Bluetooth, and UWB technologies, tapping into billions in potential market growth.</p>
                        <p><strong>3. Margin Resilience &amp; Balance Sheet Strengthening:</strong> On a non-GAAP basis, Synaptics maintained
                            gross margins of ~53–54% across FY 2025. The company also reduced gross debt by <strong>~$134 million</strong>
                            and repurchased <strong>~$128 million</strong> worth of shares in FY 2025, strengthening financial flexibility.</p>
                        <p><strong>4. Demand Stabilization &amp; Backlog Recovery:</strong> The company saw significant improvements in
                            Q4 FY2025 order activity and backlog, reflected in the strong Q1 FY2026 revenue guidance of $380–$420 million
                            (~13% YoY growth), which provides improved revenue visibility.</p>
                        <p><strong>5. TAM Expansion via Edge AI &amp; Connectivity:</strong> With edge AI chips projected to reach $60–70
                            billion by 2030, Synaptics is positioned for significant long-term growth through its Astra platform and new
                            wireless licensing agreements.</p>

                        <p>Revenue growth is being driven almost entirely by the Core IoT segment, while Mobile and Automotive remain soft.
                            Management has guided that Astra-based AI revenue contributions will begin materializing in the second half of
                            calendar 2026, which could serve as the next meaningful re-rating catalyst.</p>

                            a leaner cost structure following restructuring, with non-GAAP margins holding steady despite the ongoing

                        <p>We forecast SYNA will achieve <strong>$260 million in EBITDA by year-end 2028</strong>. Applying a
                            <strong>16.0x target multiple</strong> (based on the peer median) results in an enterprise value of $4,153 million.
                            After adjusting for the company's net cash position, the implied 3-year equity value is $4,422 million,
                            or <strong>$114.26 per share</strong>. Discounted back to September 2026 using a 9.3% cost of equity, we
                            arrive at a final price target of <strong>$95.64</strong>.</p>

                        <span class="section-label">11 — Key Risks</span>
                        <h3>Key Risks</h3>
                        <p><strong>Competitive Pressures:</strong> The semiconductor industry is intensely competitive. Synaptics faces formidable
                            rivals with greater scale and financial resources — Qualcomm, NXP, and STMicroelectronics — who could compete
                            aggressively on price or accelerate their own R&amp;D timelines.</p>
                        <p><strong>Execution Risk:</strong> Future success is contingent on flawless execution of the IoT-focused strategy.
                            Delays in the Astra™ or Veros™ product roadmaps, or a failure to secure key design wins at major OEMs, could
                            undermine the growth narrative and trigger a multiple compression.</p>
                        <p><strong>Industry Cyclicality &amp; Macro Headwinds:</strong> The semiconductor industry is inherently cyclical.
                            A significant global economic downturn could reduce consumer and enterprise spending on end-products, directly
                            impacting demand for Synaptics' components.</p>
                        <p><strong>Customer Concentration:</strong> As a supplier to major OEMs, Synaptics is exposed to customer concentration
                            risk. The loss of, or a significant reduction in orders from, a single key customer could have a material adverse
                            effect on revenue.</p>
                        <p><strong>Technological Obsolescence:</strong> The pace of technological change is relentless. Synaptics must
                            continuously invest in R&amp;D to maintain its leadership. A failure to adapt to new AI architecture standards
                            could render its products obsolete before the Astra platform reaches scale.</p>

                                We are downgrading Synaptics to a <strong style="color:white;">HOLD</strong> (from BUY). Since our Q1 FY2026 update,
                                the stock has rallied approximately 24%, and approximately 26% since our initial report. While the company continues
                                to execute exceptionally on its Edge AI pivot — with Core IoT at 74% and then 53% YoY growth — the valuation has
                                re-rated to fully reflect this success. With the stock now trading within ~11% of our fair value target of $95.64,
                                we believe the risk/reward no longer justifies adding to positions. We advise existing holders to retain their
                                shares and wait for a more attractive entry point before adding exposure.
