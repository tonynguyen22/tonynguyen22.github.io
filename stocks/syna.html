                            <strong>Recommendation:</strong> BUY</br>
                            <strong>Current Stock Price:</strong> $68.45 (as of Sep 30, 2025)</br>

                        </p>
                        <p>We initiate coverage on Synaptics, Inc. (SYNA) with a BUY recommendation. Our investment thesis is predicated on the market's significant underappreciation of Synaptics' successful strategic transformation from a legacy component supplier into a diversified, high-margin platform provider for the secular growth markets of the Internet of Things (IoT) and AI at the Edge.</p>

                    <section class="detail-section">
                        <h3>Company Overview</h3>
                        <p>Synaptics Incorporated develops, markets, and sells specialized semiconductor products that enable intelligent interactions for devices worldwide. The company's diverse product portfolio is built on a foundation of processing, wireless connectivity, sensing, and biometrics. These solutions are deployed across three primary markets: the high-growth Core IoT segment, Enterprise and Automotive, and the Mobile market. Synaptics acts as a strategic partner and supplier to many global Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs). The company's overarching strategy is a focused transition to become a pure-play Core IoT and Edge AI leader.</p>
                    </section>

                    <section class="detail-section">
                        <h3>Product Portfolio</h3>
                        <p>Synaptics' competitive advantage is built upon three integrated technology pillars. This platform approach reduces R&D burdens for OEMs, simplifies supply chains, and accelerates time-to-market.</p>
                        <p><b>Processing (Astra™):</b> The Astra™ platform is the cornerstone of Synaptics' "AI at the Edge" strategy. It is an AI-native System-on-Chip (SoC) family engineered for real-time edge intelligence, handling advanced vision, audio, and sensor processing directly on the device. A key partnership with Google Research to co-develop AI accelerators for next-generation Astra processors validates this strategy.</p>
                        <p><b>Connectivity (Veros™):</b> The Veros™ family of highly integrated wireless circuits provides essential connectivity for modern IoT devices. The portfolio is designed for speed, efficiency, and broad interoperability. Through strategic moves, including a Wi-Fi 7 agreement with Broadcom and the acquisition of Packetcraft for Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) capabilities, Synaptics is building a comprehensive wireless portfolio.</p>
                        <p><b>Sensing (Touch, Display, Biometrics):</b> This segment represents Synaptics' heritage and continues to be a source of significant innovation and cash flow. The company remains a leader in capacitive touch sensing, display drivers, and biometric solutions integral to smartphones, PCs, and automotive systems. This established business provides a stable revenue foundation that funds investment in the higher-growth Processing and Connectivity segments.</p>

                    <section class="detail-section">
                        <h3>Investment Thesis</h3>
                        <p>Our conviction in Synaptics is based on five key points:</p>
                        <p><b>First, SYNA is delivering explosive growth in core IoT.</b> The Core IoT segment delivered ~53% revenue growth year-over-year in FY 2025. This segment is increasingly the centerpiece of Synaptics' growth story and could offset stagnation in legacy segments going forward.</p>
                        <p><b>Second, SYNA is expanding its market through strategic partnerships.</b> A collaboration with Google integrates Synaptics' Astra AI-Native platform with Google's ML-Core, accelerating edge AI capabilities. An agreement with Broadcom provides access to best-in-class Wi-Fi 7/8, Bluetooth, and UWB technologies, tapping into billions in potential market growth.</p>
                        <p><b>Third, SYNA is maintaining margin resilience while strengthening its balance sheet.</b> On a non-GAAP basis, Synaptics maintained gross margins of ~53-54% across FY 2025. The company also reduced gross debt by ~$134 million and repurchased ~$128 million worth of shares in FY 2025, strengthening financial flexibility.</p>
                        <p><b>Fourth, SYNA is benefiting from demand stabilization and backlog recovery.</b> The company saw significant improvements in Q4 FY 2025 order activity and backlog. This is reflected in the strong Q1 FY 2026 revenue guidance of $380-$420 million, a ~13% YoY growth, which provides smoother revenue visibility for the upcoming fiscal year.</p>
                        <p><b>Fifth, SYNA is expanding its Total Addressable Market (TAM) by leading in edge AI and connectivity.</b> Synaptics is leveraging its Astra AI-Native platform and new wireless licensing to target the growing edge AI and advanced wireless markets. With edge AI chips projected to reach $60-70 billion by 2030, Synaptics is positioned for significant long-term growth.</p>

                        <h3>Risks</h3>
                        <p>While the thesis is compelling, investors should monitor the following risks:</p>
                        <p><b>Competitive Pressures:</b> The semiconductor industry is intensely competitive. Synaptics faces formidable rivals with greater scale and financial resources, such as Qualcomm, NXP, and STMicroelectronics, who could compete aggressively on price or R&D.</p>
                        <p><b>Execution Risk:</b> Future success is contingent upon the flawless execution of its IoT-focused strategy. Delays in the product roadmap for the Astra™ or Veros™ platforms or a failure to secure key design wins could undermine the growth narrative.</p>
                        <p><b>Industry Cyclicality & Macroeconomic Headwinds:</b> The semiconductor industry is inherently cyclical. A significant global economic downturn could reduce consumer and enterprise spending on end-products, directly impacting demand for Synaptics' components.</p>
                        <p><b>Customer Concentration:</b> As a supplier to major OEMs, Synaptics is exposed to customer concentration risk. The loss of, or a significant reduction in orders from, a single key customer could have a material adverse effect on revenue.</p>
                        <p><b>Technological Obsolescence:</b> The pace of technological change is relentless. Synaptics must continuously invest in R&D to maintain its leadership. A failure to adapt to new standards could render its products obsolete.</p>

                        <p>We forecast the company will achieve $260 million in EBITDA by year-end 2028. Applying a 16.0x target multiple (based on the peer median) results in an enterprise value of $4,153 million. After adjusting for the company's net cash position, the implied 3-year equity value is $4,422 million, or $114.26 per share. To find its present value, we discounted this price to September 2026 using a 9.3% cost of equity, resulting in a final price target of $95.64.</p>
                        <p>
                            <b>Target Multiple:</b> 16.0x<br>
                            <b>2028E EBITDA:</b> $260M<br>
                            <b>Implied Enterprise Value (EV):</b> $4,153M<br>
                            <b>3-Year Price Target (2028):</b> $114.26<br>
                            <b>Discounted 1-Year Price Target: $95.64</b>
                         </p>
                        <p>This suggests a 39.7% upside from the current share price of $68.45.</p>
