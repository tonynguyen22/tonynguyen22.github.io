                                <p>GXO closed 2025 with record results, setting a solid foundation for 2026. However, the stock
                                    price has appreciated significantly and is now trading <strong>above our price target</strong>.
                                    Current price: <strong>$63.36</strong>.</p>

                                <h4>Key Highlights from Q4 2025</h4>
                                <p><strong>Record Financials:</strong> GXO delivered a strong finish with record Q4 revenue of
                                    <strong>$3.5 billion (+7.9% YoY)</strong> and record adjusted EBITDA of <strong>$255 million</strong>.
                                    For the full year 2025, revenue reached <strong>$13.2 billion (+12.5% YoY)</strong>,
                                    with organic growth across every region.</p>
                                <p><strong>2026 Guidance &amp; Acceleration:</strong> Management issued 2026 guidance projecting
                                    <strong>4–5% organic revenue growth</strong> and Adjusted Diluted EPS growth of approximately
                                    <strong>~20% ($2.85–$3.15)</strong>. Notably, this is based on a conservative "flat volumes"
                                    macro assumption, de-risking the outlook.</p>
                                <p><strong>Strategic Pivot to Global Standardization:</strong> Under CEO Patrick Kelleher, the company
                                    is shifting from regional autonomy to a unified global operating model. New appointments include
                                    COO Bart Beeks (driving margin expansion) and CCO Karen Baumer (sharpening commercial execution
                                    in Aerospace, Defense, and Life Sciences).</p>
                                <p><strong>Technology &amp; AI Leadership:</strong> GXO plans to have nearly <strong>20,000 robots</strong>
                                    in operation by 2026. The company is aggressively rolling out "GXO IQ," an AI-powered operating
                                    system, and piloting humanoid robots for long-term productivity gains.</p>

                                <h4>Key Highlights</h4>
                                <p><strong>Financial Performance:</strong> GXO reported record quarterly revenue of $3.4 billion and
                                    adjusted EBITDA of $251 million (up 13% YoY). Margins expanded 100 bps sequentially. However,
                                    organic revenue growth <strong>slowed to 4%</strong> (from 6% in Q2), driven by "softer trends in volumes."</p>
                                <p><strong>Strategic Execution:</strong> Integration milestones were hit with the official combination of
                                    Wincanton and the successful "flawless" launch of the NHS Supply Chain contract. Additionally, the
                                    company secured $700 million in incremental revenue for 2026.</p>
                                <p><strong>Balance Sheet:</strong> Net leverage improved to <strong>2.7x</strong> (down from 3.0x in Q2),
                                    significantly improving financial flexibility.</p>

                                    — prompting management to raise full-year 2025 guidance for the second time in two months.</p>
                                <p><strong>Wincanton Approval:</strong> Final regulatory approval received, clearing the path for
                                    European expansion and an expected <strong>$60 million in synergies by 2026</strong>.</p>
                                <p><strong>Financial Health:</strong> GXO achieved an <strong>investment-grade credit rating from all
                                    three major agencies</strong>. The company also repurchased 5.4 million shares, signaling management

                            They are the expert operational partner for major brands — when you buy a product, GXO is often the one

                        <p>What truly sets GXO apart is its deep integration of <strong>technology, robotics, AI, and advanced software</strong>
                            to make clients' supply chains faster and more efficient. This is more than a warehousing business — it is
                            a tech-driven logistics platform, and that distinction is the core of the investment thesis.</p>
                        <p>GXO generated record full-year 2024 revenue of <strong>$11.7 billion</strong> (up 20% from 2023) and record
                            adjusted EBITDA of <strong>$815 million</strong>. For FY2025, revenue grew to <strong>$13.2 billion (+12.5% YoY)</strong>,
                            with organic growth across every region.</p>

                        <h3>Industry Context</h3>
                        <p>GXO operates in an industry with a <strong>powerful and sustained secular tailwind</strong>. The global
                            e-commerce market is forecast to grow at nearly <strong>15% annually</strong> for the next decade, from
                            roughly $19 trillion today to over <strong>$75 trillion by 2034</strong>. As supply chains become more
                            complex and delivery standards increase, the need to outsource to sophisticated operators like GXO
                            will only grow.</p>
                        <p>The contract logistics industry is also undergoing a structural shift toward <strong>tech-enabled, automated
                            operations</strong>. Companies that have invested heavily in robotics and AI — like GXO — are increasingly
                            winning contracts away from traditional, labor-intensive operators. This creates a virtuous cycle: better
                            technology attracts more clients, generating revenue to fund further R&amp;D.</p>
                        <p>GXO's recent landmark win — a <strong>$2.5 billion lifetime value deal with the UK NHS</strong> in the
                            healthcare sector — also signals the company's expansion into non-cyclical, mission-critical verticals,
                            adding a layer of revenue stability that pure-play e-commerce operators do not have.</p>

                        <h3>Competitive Advantages &amp; Moat</h3>
                        <p><strong>Technology Platform (Primary Moat):</strong> GXO's most durable advantage is its technology, which
                            creates a true competitive moat. Heavy investment in automation and software leads to efficiencies that
                            smaller rivals cannot match. Management projects that robotics and AI initiatives will directly contribute
                            <strong>$110–$130 million to Adjusted EBITDA by 2027</strong>, turning technological leadership into
                            tangible, quantified profit growth. Plans to operate nearly 20,000 robots by 2026 and the rollout of the
                            "GXO IQ" AI operating system deepen this advantage.</p>
                        <p><strong>Long-Term Contracts &amp; Switching Costs:</strong> GXO embeds itself deeply into clients' supply
                            chain operations — often designing, building, and operating bespoke warehouse facilities. This creates
                            very high switching costs, as transitioning to a new logistics provider would require significant disruption
                            and re-integration effort. The 10-year NHS contract exemplifies this dynamic.</p>
                        <p><strong>Scale &amp; Geographic Reach:</strong> As the world's largest pure-play contract logistics company,
                            GXO has scale advantages in procurement, technology investment, and talent acquisition. The Wincanton
                            acquisition accelerated its European footprint, particularly in the UK and in specialist sectors like
                            aerospace logistics — contributing an expected <strong>$120–$130 million in additional EBITDA by 2027</strong>.</p>
                        <p><strong>Blue-Chip Customer Base:</strong> GXO's clients include global household names across e-commerce,
                            retail, consumer goods, and healthcare. The diversity and prestige of this customer base provides both
                            revenue stability and strong reference value when competing for new contracts.</p>

                        <p>The 2026 narrative is one of <strong>acceleration and margin expansion</strong>. The conservative volume
                            assumptions are prudent given macro uncertainty, and $774 million in already-secured incremental revenue
                            provides strong visibility. The Wincanton synergies and NHS contract ramp-up are expected to be key
                            margin drivers through 2026–2027.</p>

                            full. The ~20% EPS growth guidance for 2026 could theoretically support a higher multiple, but we
                            prefer to remain disciplined. A material beat in upcoming quarters or a positive re-rating catalyst
                            would be needed before we revisit the price target to the upside.</p>

                            <em>Mitigating Factor:</em> The management team's deep experience with large-scale M&amp;A —
                            particularly from their time at XPO — significantly reduces this risk.</p>

                            <em>Mitigating Factor:</em> GXO's heavy investment in automation directly counters rising labor costs
                            by increasing productivity and reducing headcount dependency over time.</p>
                        <p><strong>Organic Growth Deceleration</strong> — Q3 2025 saw organic growth slow from 6% to 4%,
                            and management's "flat volumes" macro assumption for 2026 reflects genuine macro uncertainty.</p>

                                We are maintaining a <strong style="color:white;">HOLD</strong> rating on GXO Logistics.
                                Following record full-year 2025 results, the stock has appreciated significantly — now trading
                                slightly <em>above</em> our calculated 2-year price target of $62.01. While the 2026 guidance
                                of ~20% EPS growth is strong and the long-term thesis remains intact, we believe the current
                                valuation fully captures near-term optimism. Given the stock has surpassed our target and
                                management has adopted a prudent "flat volume" macro outlook, we see limited upside from these
                                levels without a material beat in upcoming quarters. We would revisit a BUY rating on a pullback
                                toward the mid-to-high $50s range.
