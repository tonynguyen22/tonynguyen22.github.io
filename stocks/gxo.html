                           <strong>Current Stock Price:</strong> $48.00 (as of June 20, 2025)</br>

                        <p>We are initiating a BUY rating for GXO Logistics. In our view, recent positive news has cleared major uncertainties and proven the strength of the company’s long-term strategy. We believe the market has not yet fully priced in the company's accelerating momentum, presenting a compelling investment opportunity.</p>

                        <h3>Company Overview</h3>
                        <p>GXO Logistics is the world's largest company that focuses exclusively on contract logistics. Simply put, they are the expert operational partner for major brands. When you buy a product, GXO is often the one storing it, picking and packing it for shipment, and managing the entire returns process. Their revenue comes from these long-term contracts with a blue-chip customer base in sectors like e-commerce, retail, and technology. What truly sets GXO apart, in our opinion, is their deep integration of technology, robotics, AI, and advanced software, to make their clients' supply chains faster and more efficient.</p>
                    </section>

                    <section class="detail-section">
                        <h3>Business Performance (2024 Review & Q1 2025)</h3>
                        <p>
                            GXO finished 2024 on a high note, successfully executing its growth strategy and delivering strong financial results. The company entered 2025 with this underlying momentum, though first-quarter profitability was impacted by temporary, well-defined factors that we believe do not change the long-term investment thesis.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            For the full year 2024, GXO achieved record revenue of <strong>$11.7 billion</strong> (a 20% increase from 2023) and record adjusted EBITDA of <strong>$815 million</strong>. This performance was driven by impressive commercial success, including securing over $1 billion in new contracts with major brands like Levi's and LG, and a landmark $2.5 billion lifetime value deal in the healthcare sector. The successful integration of Clipper Logistics was also a key driver, fueling 60% year-over-year revenue growth in Germany.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            This strong backdrop helps explain the mixed results in Q1 2025, where profits were temporarily pressured. Management attributed this to two main factors: first, a strategic realignment of warehouse space by a few large customers, where new, more profitable contracts are taking time to ramp up; and second, a longer-than-expected regulatory review of the Wincanton acquisition, which delayed the realization of cost synergies. We view these as short-term operational timings rather than a weakness in demand.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Despite the Q1 profit pressure, the underlying business remains robust. Management reiterated its full-year 2025 guidance for <strong>3% to 6% organic revenue growth</strong> and adjusted EBITDA between $840 million and $860 million. This confidence is supported by a strong and growing sales pipeline, which was up 15% year-over-year, indicating continued high demand for GXO's services.

                    <section class="detail-section">
                        <h3>Investment Thesis</h3>
                        <p>We believe the case for investing in GXO has grown significantly stronger, and our conviction is based on four key points:</p>
                        <p><b>First,</b> we think GXO’s most durable advantage is its technology, which creates a true competitive "moat." This is more than just a warehousing business; it’s a tech-driven logistics platform. Their heavy investment in automation and software leads to efficiencies that smaller rivals simply can't match. We can now quantify the impact of this strategy: management projects that robotics and AI initiatives will directly contribute between $110 million and $130 million to Adjusted EBITDA by 2027, turning technological leadership into tangible profit growth.</p>
                        <p><b>Second,</b> we see a clear path to profitable growth from the company's acquisition strategy. With the recent UK regulatory approval for the Wincanton deal, a major uncertainty has been lifted. We believe management can now focus completely on the integration, and the financial prize is significant: GXO expects the Wincanton business to contribute an additional $120 million to $130 million in Adjusted EBITDA by 2027. Furthermore, this deal strategically positions GXO as a leader in the complex and lucrative aerospace logistics sector.</p>
                        <p><b>Third,</b> the company's strategy is now being validated by major new business wins. In our view, the recent 10-year, $2.5 billion contract with the UK's NHS is a landmark achievement. This isn't just a big contract; it's proof that GXO can win complex, long-term business in essential sectors like healthcare, which adds a layer of stability to future revenues.</p>
                        <p><b>Fourth,</b> we think the market's reaction to the new leadership is significant. The 7% jump in the stock price after Patrick Kelleher was named CEO shows us that other investors are beginning to share our confidence in the company's strategic direction and its ability to execute.</p>
                        <p><b>Finally,</b> GXO is operating in an industry with a powerful and sustained tailwind. The global e-commerce market is forecast to grow at nearly 15% annually for the next decade, from roughly $19 trillion today to over $75 trillion by 2034. As supply chains become more complex and delivery standards increase, the need to outsource to sophisticated operators like GXO will only grow, providing a strong foundation for organic growth for years to come.</p>

                        <h3>Risks and Mitigating Factors</h3>
                        <p>While we are bullish on GXO, investors should be aware of the potential risks.</p>
                        <p><b>Risk:</b> A broad economic slowdown is the primary risk, as it could reduce overall shipping volumes.<br>
                           <em>Mitigating Factor:</em> We believe GXO is well-insulated. Its customer base is diverse, and the new NHS contract adds significant, non-cyclical revenue from the healthcare industry.</p>
                        <p><b>Risk:</b> The integration of Wincanton could be more complex or costly than anticipated.<br>
                           <em>Mitigating Factor:</em> In our view, the management team's deep experience with large-scale M&A, particularly from their time at XPO, significantly reduces this risk.</p>
                        <p><b>Risk:</b> Rising labor costs could pressure profit margins.<br>
                           <em>Mitigating Factor:</em> We think this is a key reason GXO's strategy will win long-term. Their heavy investment in automation directly counters rising labor costs by making their operations more productive and less reliant on manual work.</p>

                    <section class="detail-section">
                        <h3>Valuation</h3>
                        <p>For our analysis, we are using a forward-looking earnings model to determine a multi-year price target, which we believe provides a more detailed view of the company's intrinsic value than a simple peer comparison.</p>
                        <p>Our model is built on several key assumptions, starting with a 2024 revenue base of $11.7 billion. We project this forward using what we consider an achievable 8.2% annual growth rate. To determine future profit, we apply a stable 4.2% operating margin.</p>
                        <p>By projecting revenue, calculating operating profit, and then estimating interest and taxes, our model forecasts that GXO can achieve an Earnings Per Share (EPS) of approximately $3.40 by the end of 2027.</p>
                        <p>To find our price target, we apply a conservative exit P/E multiple of 16.5x to this future earning power.</p>
                        <p>
                            <b>Formula:</b> Projected 2027 EPS x Exit P/E Multiple<br>
                            <b>Calculation:</b> $3.76 x 16.5x<br>
                            <b>Year-End 2027 Price Target: $62.01</b>
                        </p>
                        <p>Based on our report's current price of $48.00, this multi-year target implies the following returns:</p>
                        <p>
                            <b>Total Return:</b> ($62.01 - $48.00) / $48.00 = 29.1%<br>
                            <b>Annualized Return (over ~2 years):</b> 12.05%
                        </p>
                        <p>While this fundamentally-driven target of $62.01 is different from a simple peer comparison, it provides a detailed, multi-year view of the company's value creation potential. The resulting 12.05% annualized return, based on what we consider reasonable and achievable assumptions, strongly supports our BUY rating.</p>

                        <h3>Update Q22025 (As of August 05, 2025)</h3>
                        <p>This update reflects our analysis of GXO's highly positive Q2 2025 earnings call, which reinforces our initial BUY thesis. The stock price as of this update is <strong>$49.31</strong>.</p>
                        
                        <h4 style="margin-bottom: 0.5rem;">Key Highlights from Q2 2025:</h4>
                        <p><strong>Financial Performance:</strong> The company delivered record Q2 revenue of $3.3 billion and adjusted EBITDA of $212 million. Organic revenue growth accelerated to 6%, its highest in nine quarters, prompting management to raise its full-year 2025 guidance for the second time in two months.</p>
                        <p><strong>Strategic Execution:</strong> The strategic acquisition of Wincanton received final regulatory approval, clearing the path for GXO's expansion into key European markets and an expected $60 million in synergies by 2026.</p>
                        <p><strong>Financial Health & Capital Allocation:</strong> GXO's robust financial position was validated by achieving an investment-grade credit rating from all three major agencies. The company also repurchased 5.4 million shares, signaling management's confidence in the stock's value.</p>
                        <p><strong>Leadership:</strong> While the company announced a planned leadership transition, we view it as well-managed and do not expect it to alter the successful corporate strategy.</p>

                        <h4>Updated Outlook:</h4>
                        <p>In our view, these strong Q2 results and the confident outlook significantly strengthen the investment case. The successful execution of the Wincanton strategy and accelerating organic growth validate our thesis. While the stock has appreciated since our initial report, we believe substantial upside remains.</p>
                        <p>
                            <b>Updated Potential Upside:</b> ($62.01 - $49.31) / $49.31 = <strong>25.7%</strong>
                        </p>
                        <p>We reiterate our <strong>BUY</strong> rating.</p>
